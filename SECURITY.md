# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Security Commitment

Mnemosyne takes security seriously. As an AI agent platform that handles sensitive data, API keys, and personal knowledge, we are committed to maintaining the highest security standards to protect our users.

## üîí Security Features

### Data Protection

- **AES-256 Encryption** - All API keys are encrypted using military-grade encryption
- **Vault-Scoped Keys** - Each Obsidian vault uses unique encryption keys
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** - Master passwords are never stored or transmitted
- **Local Processing** - Option to keep all data processing completely local with Ollama
- **Secure Memory** - Automatic cleanup of sensitive data from memory

### API Key Security

- **Encrypted Storage** - API keys are encrypted before storage
- **In-Memory Protection** - Keys are only decrypted when needed
- **Vault Isolation** - Keys are isolated per Obsidian vault
- **No Cloud Storage** - Keys never leave your device unencrypted

### Network Security

- **HTTPS Only** - All external API communications use TLS 1.2+
- **Certificate Validation** - Proper SSL/TLS certificate verification
- **No Data Collection** - No telemetry or usage data is collected
- **Local-First** - Most operations work entirely offline

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Full support    |

2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form

#### Option 2: Email
Send details to: **security@mnemosyne-ai.com** (or contact through GitHub if email unavailable)

### üìã What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the issue
- **Location of affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)

- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- **Response Time**: 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
- **Examples**: Information disclosure, denial of service

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- **Response Time**: 2 weeks
- **Fix Timeline**: Next regular release

- **Thanked** in release notes
- **Added** to our Hall of Fame (if significant finding)
- **Considered** for bug bounty rewards (program coming soon)

## üîí Security Best Practices for Users

### API Key Management

- ‚úÖ **Use strong master passwords** (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ‚úÖ **Never share your master password** with anyone
- ‚úÖ **Use different master passwords** for different vaults
- ‚úÖ **Regularly rotate API keys** with your AI providers
- ‚ùå **Never commit API keys to version control**

### Vault Security

- ‚úÖ **Keep Obsidian updated** to the latest version
- ‚úÖ **Keep Mnemosyne updated** to the latest version
- ‚úÖ **Use encrypted storage** for sensitive vaults
- ‚úÖ **Regular backups** of your encrypted vault data
- ‚ùå **Don't store sensitive data in plain text** in notes

### Network Security

- ‚úÖ **Use secure networks** when accessing cloud AI services
- ‚úÖ **Consider local AI** (Ollama) for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Enable firewall** protection on your device
- ‚ùå **Avoid public WiFi** for sensitive AI operations

## üîç Security Audits

### Internal Security Measures

- **Code Reviews** - All code changes undergo security review
- **Dependency Scanning** - Regular audits of third-party dependencies
- **Static Analysis** - Automated security scanning of our codebase
- **Penetration Testing** - Regular security testing of the application

### External Audits

- **Third-party Security Audit**: Planned for Q2 2024
- **Dependency Audits**: Monthly automated scans
- **Community Review**: Open source for transparency
