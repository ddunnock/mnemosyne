# Specification Quality Checklist: RAG Agent System Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Check
**Status**: ✅ PASS

All content is written at the appropriate abstraction level:
- User stories describe what users want to accomplish, not how to implement it
- Requirements focus on capabilities and behaviors
- Success criteria are outcome-based
- Assumptions section lists prerequisites without implementation constraints

### Requirement Completeness Check
**Status**: ✅ PASS

All requirements are well-defined:
- 30 functional requirements covering all aspects of the refactor
- Each requirement is testable and specific
- No ambiguous [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Edge cases thoroughly documented with expected behaviors
- Clear scope boundaries (what's included vs. excluded)

### Technology-Agnostic Check
**Status**: ✅ PASS

Success criteria avoid implementation specifics while remaining measurable:
- SC-001: "within 5 minutes" - time-based, not implementation-specific
- SC-002: "query response times under 5 seconds" - performance metric, not technical detail
- SC-003: "90% of new users successfully create first agent" - user outcome
- SC-004: "100+ notes per minute" - throughput metric
- SC-008: "keeping memory usage under 500MB" - resource constraint, acceptable for performance criteria
- SC-010: "zero occurrences" - verification metric

Note: SC-002 and SC-008 include specific technical metrics (offline operation, memory usage), but these are acceptable as they describe non-functional requirements that users directly experience (privacy, performance).

### Feature Independence Check
**Status**: ✅ PASS

Each user story can be developed and tested independently:
- US1 (General-Purpose Agents): Standalone value with template library
- US2 (Local AI): Independent offline capability
- US3 (Template Library): Can work with basic agents
- US4 (Native Vault Integration): Independent metadata handling
- US5 (Intelligent Ingestion): Standalone processing pipeline

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No blocking issues identified
- All quality gates passed
- Feature scope is well-defined and deliverable
- Success criteria provide clear validation targets

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ APPROVED FOR PLANNING
