## Common Questions

### Q: How much does it cost?
**A**: Depends on your provider:
- **OpenAI**: ~$0.01-0.03 per query (GPT-3.5) or $0.05-0.15 per query (GPT-4)
- **Ollama Local**: FREE (but requires powerful computer)
- **Anthropic**: Similar to OpenAI pricing

**Tip**: Start with GPT-3.5-turbo for cost-effective testing, upgrade to GPT-4 when you need better quality.

### Q: Is my data private?
**A**:
- **Cloud (OpenAI/Anthropic)**: Your notes are sent to the API for processing, covered by their privacy policies
- **Local (Ollama)**: 100% private, everything runs on your computer
- **API Keys**: Encrypted with AES-256 and stored securely in your vault

### Q: How many notes can it handle?
**A**: Tested with up to 10,000 notes. Performance depends on:
- Vault size: 10-1,000 notes (instant), 1,000-5,000 (seconds), 5,000+ (may need optimization)
- Hardware: Better CPU = faster ingestion and local AI

### Q: Can I use multiple AI providers?
**A**: Yes! Configure multiple providers and choose per-agent:
- Agent 1: OpenAI GPT-4 (best quality)
- Agent 2: GPT-3.5 (fast and cheap)
- Agent 3: Ollama Llama2 (private and offline)

### Q: What if ingestion fails?
**A**: Check:
1. **File Permissions**: Ensure Obsidian can read your vault files
2. **API Limits**: You may have hit rate limits, wait a few minutes
3. **Malformed Notes**: Check error log for specific files with issues
4. **Exclude Problematic Files**: Add exclude patterns for files that cause errors

### Q: How do I update my knowledge base?
**A**: Automatic! Mnemosyne watches for file changes and auto-updates embeddings. You can also manually trigger:
- Command Palette ‚Üí "**Mnemosyne: Refresh Index**"

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid" Error
- **OpenAI**: Verify key at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic**: Check [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- **Ollama**: Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama list` in terminal)

### "No Results Found"
- **Check Ingestion**: Settings ‚Üí Mnemosyne ‚Üí View ingestion status
- **Check Folders**: Verify selected folders contain the notes you're asking about
- **Lower Relevance**: In agent settings, decrease `minRelevance` from 0.7 to 0.5

### Slow Responses
- **OpenAI/Anthropic**: Normal, cloud latency (3-10 seconds)
- **Ollama**: First query loads model (10-30 seconds), subsequent queries faster
- **Too Many Sources**: Reduce `maxResults` in retrieval settings

### Plugin Won't Load
- **Version Check**: Obsidian 1.4.0+ required
- **Reload**: Cmd+R (Mac) or Ctrl+R (Windows) to reload Obsidian
- **Check Console**: View ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools ‚Üí Console for errors
